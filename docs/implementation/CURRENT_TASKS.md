# Current Implementation Tasks - Desktop Meeting Recorder

## Project Overview
Transform the forked Muesli app (Recall.ai demo) into a fully integrated Nex Desktop Meeting Recorder that works seamlessly with the existing Nex CRM meeting bot infrastructure.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

#### 1. Repository Setup
- Forked muesli-public to nex-crm/desktop-meeting-recorder
- Set up documentation structure
- Created implementation plan

#### 2. Authentication Service (OAuth2 Flow)
- Created NexAuthService with OAuth2 flow
- Implemented SecureStorage with encryption
- Added JWT token management with auto-refresh
- Integrated auth into main.js with login prompts
- Added IPC handlers for auth operations
- Fixed isAuthenticated() to return boolean instead of JWT token string
- Added user data validation and automatic re-authentication detection
- Fixed name field extraction to properly handle protobuf structure (full_name vs fullName)
- Added safeguard to prevent email being displayed as name

#### 3. Backend Integration for Desktop Auth
- Added `/v1/auth/desktop/exchange` endpoint in core/internal/iam/http/handler.go
- Returns refresh token for desktop app when authenticated via cookies
- Registered route with CSRF protection
- Fixed cookie path from `/api/v1/auth/token` to `/api/v1/auth` for broader access

#### 4. Web App Desktop Login Detection
- Modified login hooks to detect desktop login (desktop=true param)
- Added token exchange call after successful login
- Redirects to desktop app with token on success
- Fixed response parsing for correct token structure

#### 5. Calendar Integration
- Created CalendarSyncService with 5-minute sync
- Implemented meeting notifications (15, 5, 1 minute)
- Added auto-record capability
- Local caching for offline access
- Meeting detection helpers

#### 6. API Service Layer
- Created comprehensive NexApiService
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implemented all meeting/calendar endpoints
- Device fingerprinting support

#### 7. Environment Configuration
- Updated .env with correct localhost URLs
- Configured for local development (localhost:30000/api)
- Added Recall.ai API keys
- Added debug panel environment flag (SHOW_DEBUG_PANEL)

### Phase 2: UI Enhancements (COMPLETED)

#### 1. Granola-Style Sidebar
- Created TranscriptService module for managing transcript/notes
- Implemented collapsible sidebar with smooth animations
- Added Copy Text functionality for meeting notes
- Added Download Transcript feature with clean "Speaker: Text" format
- Sidebar auto-shows in editor view, starts collapsed
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Dark theme matching app design
- Fixed sidebar toggle button visibility issues
- Proper icon direction changes (left arrow when collapsed, right arrow when expanded)

#### 2. Live Transcript Feature
- Implemented WhatsApp-style chat UI for live transcript
- Chat bubbles with speaker names and timestamps
- Automatic grouping of consecutive messages from same speaker
- Real-time updates during recording
- Placeholder state when no transcript available
- Integrated with existing transcript update events

#### 3. Unified Recording Button
- Merged "Record In-person Meeting" and "Record Meeting" buttons
- Dynamic text and icons based on meeting detection:
  - Purple button with microphone icon: "Record Meeting with Audio only" (no meeting detected)
  - Green button with video icon: "Record Meeting with Video" (meeting detected)
- Single action handler that routes based on context

#### 4. UI Fixes and Improvements
- Fixed avatar menu dropdown click handler
- Fixed debug panel styling issues
- Fixed meeting card icon spacing (12px margin)
- Fixed trash icon alignment on cards (right side positioning)
- Fixed sidebar state management when navigating between views
- Added proper disabled state styling for buttons

### Phase 3: Custom Notification System (COMPLETED)

#### 1. Custom Notification Window
- Implemented always-on-top custom notification window (bypasses DND mode)
- Clean, minimal macOS-style design with white background
- Single "Start Recording" CTA button
- 60-second display duration
- Slide-in animation from right side
- Position: top-right corner (30px from top, 380px from right edge)

#### 2. Smart Meeting Detection
- Tracks meetings by unique session key (platform + window ID)
- Shows notification only on first detection per meeting
- Prevents duplicate notifications when stopping/restarting recording
- Clears tracking only when meeting window actually closes

#### 3. Duplicate Prevention Logic
- Uses `handledMeetingSessions` Set to track notified meetings
- Checks for existing notes before creating new ones
- Prevents multiple notes for the same meeting session
- Maintains state across recording stop/start cycles

#### 4. Technical Implementation
- Custom HTML/CSS loaded as data URL (no webpack dependency)
- IPC handlers for notification actions
- Integration with existing meeting detection flow
- Removed in-app notification system (purple gradient popups)

## Current Authentication Flow

### How It Works:
1. **Desktop Initiates**: Opens browser to `http://localhost:5173/login?desktop=true&redirect_uri=nex://auth/callback&state=<random_state>`
2. **User Logs In**: Completes normal web login (email/OTP or Google OAuth)
3. **Token Exchange**: Web app detects desktop parameter and exchanges cookies for refresh token
4. **Desktop Redirect**: Web app redirects to `nex://auth/callback?token=<refresh_token>&state=<state>`
5. **Token Management**: Desktop app uses refresh token to get access token, stores securely, auto-refreshes

### Security Features:
- State parameter prevents CSRF attacks
- Tokens never exposed in web app JavaScript (uses HttpOnly cookies)
- Exchange endpoint requires valid auth cookies
- Desktop app validates state before accepting tokens

## Testing Notes

### TEMPORARY Testing Configuration
**Status**: Active in desktop-meeting-recorder repo

The authentication flow has a temporary modification for Playwright testing:
- When `USE_INTERNAL_BROWSER=true`, uses BrowserWindow instead of external browser
- Production should always use `shell.openExternal` for security

```bash
# Testing with controlled browser
USE_INTERNAL_BROWSER=true npm run start:debug

# Production (default)
npm start
```

**IMPORTANT**: This must be reverted before production deployment.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. Copy Text may need clipboard permissions in packaged app
2. Download may need save dialog integration for packaged app
3. Transcript only updates when meeting data is reloaded from file

- Purple date badges matching Granola design
- Meeting titles and times clearly displayed
- Real-time updates via calendar sync

#### 3. Smart Meeting View
- **Today's meetings by default**: Shows only today's meetings initially
- **"Show more/less" toggle**: Expands to show full week's meetings
- **Responsive filtering**: Separates today's vs week's meetings
- **Graceful fallback**: Shows first 3 weekly meetings if no meetings today

#### 4. Future Meeting Handling
- **Time-based UI**: Different interface for future vs current meetings
- **"Starts at [time]" display**: Shows meeting start time for future meetings
- **"Start now" button**: Appears for meetings within 2 hours
- **Auto-hide recording controls**: Recording buttons hidden for future meetings
- **Bottom overlay indicator**: Clean time display at bottom of note editor

#### 5. Meeting Notes Management
- **Click to create**: Clicking upcoming meeting creates note automatically
- **Future note separation**: Future meeting notes excluded from past notes list
- **isFuture flag**: Tracks meeting state for proper categorization
- **Seamless transition**: Notes move from upcoming to past after meeting time

#### 6. Mock Data for Development
- Added fallback mock data when calendar API unavailable
- Allows UI testing without backend integration
- Simulates upcoming meetings for demonstration

## Next Steps
The foundation is complete with authentication, recording, UI enhancements, and calendar integration done. The project now has a Granola-like interface with upcoming meetings and date-organized notes. Ready for the next phase of development based on updated requirements.
